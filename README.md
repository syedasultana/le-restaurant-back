# le-restaurant-back

This is the back-end side of a full stack app I built called Le Restaurant. I used Node and Express to create this with a Postgres database. It interacts with the front-end via API requests - both GET and POST requests are used. 
To see the code for the front-end, visit: https://github.com/syedasultana/le-restaurant-front
